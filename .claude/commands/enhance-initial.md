# Enhance Initial Feature Description

Enhances INITIAL.md by adding concrete codebase context to prepare it as better input for generate-prp.

## Process

1. **Read INITIAL.md**
    - Understand feature requirements
    - Identify what's missing

2. **Analyze Codebase**
    - Review CLAUDE.md for project overview
    - Find similar patterns in code
    - Identify specific files to reference

3. **Enhance INITIAL.md**
    - Add concrete paths to relevant files
    - Add references to similar implementations in the project
    - Make examples more specific with real codebase references
    - Preserve original structure but enrich with context

4. **Write Enhanced INITIAL.md**
    - Overwrite original file with enhanced version
    - Preserve original language
    - Add specific file paths and line numbers where relevant

## What to Enhance

### EXAMPLES Section
- Instead of generic references, add concrete paths
- E.g., "Look at TaskEntity in `src/main/java/.../TaskEntity.java:15`"

### FEATURE Section
- Add notes about existing similar implementations
- Add warnings if there are edge cases in the project

### DOCUMENTATION Section
- Keep external links
- Add internal references to CLAUDE.md and other relevant files

## Output
Overwrites `INITIAL.md` with enhanced content.
